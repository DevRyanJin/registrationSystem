# registrationSystem

## Implement a registration system using CGI scripts. 
## The system will use cookies to recognize registered users and keep track of their credit card numbers. 
## If, on visiting your site, there is no credit card information returned in a cookie, present the visitor with a registration page. 
## If there is credit card information, present a page welcoming them and showing them their saved credit card number.
